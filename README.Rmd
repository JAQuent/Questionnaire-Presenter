Questionnaire Presenter is a free-standing application built with Unity3D (version 2021.3.1f1c1) and the [Unity Experiment Framework](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework) that allows you to quickly & easily run questionnaires on a computer. The user does not need to have any programming experience or even have Unity3D install on the target machine. The questionnaire is constructed by providing a simple .txt file with tab-separated values, which can be created with a spreadsheet program like Excel or LibreOffice. The questionnaire then presents each question as a single item on a screen. As of now, multi-item presentations are  not supported (If that is what you need, please check out [VRQuestionnaireToolkit](https://github.com/MartinFk/VRQuestionnaireToolkit)). Questionnaire Presenter was designed to be as lightweight and as simple as possible so I decided to restrict it to one question per page. 

Illustration how the application looks like:

# General introduction

As explained above, you simply need to copy your .txt file with tab-separate values into the `StreamingAssets` folder of the program (the exactly depends on whether you use the Window or the Mac version of Questionnaire Presenter). The .txt must contains the following columns (please note that the names of the columns need to match exactly including being case-sensitive).

- `trialType`
- `question`
- `options`
- `minimumDuration`

Optional columns but relevant for UXF (see UXF's website for more details), which will determine the order in which the questions are presented:

- `trial_num`
- `block_num`

# Example input files
Example input files can be found in the `example` folder. 

## Example `QP_input.txt` file

| trial_num | block_num | trialType | question                      | options                 | minimumDuration |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| 1         | 1         | message   | Welcome to this questionnaire | NA                      | 3               |
| 2         | 2         | slider    | Do you like this program?     | yes\|no                 | 3               |
| 3         | 2         | textLong  | Tell me your life story.      | Type life story here... | 3               |
| 4         | 3         | dropdown  | Which platform did you use?   | Windows\|Mac            | 3               |

# Further input through session .json file
The most important input comes in form of the `trial_specification_name`, which specifies the .txt file that is used to construct the questionnaire. `targetFrameRate` allows you to set a maximal number to cap the frames per second, which might be helpful to reduce between device variability if so desired. `alignment` allows you to change the text alignment with text anchors. (see [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/TextAnchor.html) for more information). `confirmButtonLabel` is used to change the label of the confirmation button. 

The other input are really only relevant if HTTPPost (see [here for an explanation](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework/wiki/HTTP-POST-setup)) is used to collect data remotely. If you want to do that, you can specify the relevant server by setting url, username & password. If the application is closed to early, it is possible that the data is not completely send to the server which can lead to data loss. Therefore, if HTTPPost is used, a end screen counting down from `endCountDown` along with the message specified in `endMessage` is presented, which will wait with closing the application until the time is over. It is probably advisable to test how much time you need so that your data is actually saved. Note the name of this file must start with `QP_` in order to be recognised by UXF.

```json
{
  "trial_specification_name": "QP_input.txt",
  "targetFrameRate": 60,
  "alignment": "LowerCenter", 
  "confirmButtonLabel": "Confirm",
  "endCountDown" : 60,
  "endMessage": "Thank you for completing the task.\n\nPlease wait briefly before you close the application.\n\nSeconds remaining: ",
  "useHTTPPost": false,
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5000/form",
  "username": "susan",
  "password": "hello"
}
```

## Customisation of the UXF Startup panel using a .json file 
The UXF Startup panel can be customised by changing values in the .json file called `startupText.json`, which is also found the `StreamingAssets` folder and looks like this:

```json
{
    "chromeBar": "Questionnaire Presenter (version 0.1)",
    "instructionsPanelContent1": "Welcome to this part of this study",
    "instructionsPanelContent2": "You can add instructions here.",
    "expSettingsprofile": "Experiment settings profile",
    "localPathElement": "Local data save directory",
    "localPathElement_placeHolder": "Press browse button to select...",
    "participantID": "Participant ID",
    "participantID_placeholder": "Enter text...",
    "sessionNumber": "Session number",
    "termsAndConditions": "Please tick if you understand the instructions and agree for your data to be collected and used for research purposes.<color=red>*</color>",
    "beginButton": "Begin session"
}
```

All that needs to be done is to edit the fields in this file to display your information instead of the standard text. 

# Data saved
## Main results
Here is a quick guide what data is saved by Questionnaire Presenter. For more information please also check [Unity Experiment Framework](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework)] but the main result can be found in `trail_results.csv`. Here is the data that was generated in the video shown above;

```{r load_data}
# Libraries
library(knitr)

# Load main results
data <- read.csv("QP_my_experiment/subject1/S001/trial_results.csv", header = TRUE)

# Display as table 
kable(data)
```

Here is what the most important columns that are unique to this application mean:

- _ppid_ = The participant ID. 
- _trailType_ = Question type used in this trial.  
- _question_ = The question that was used in this trial. 
- _value_ = The response given by the participant. Please look above for the different value types. 

Note due to UXF's API “,” in responses & input are converted into “\_”.

For the most part, the way to analyse the response should be fairly obvious. The only tricky bit might be to analyse radio & checkmark questions. Here is short a demonstration to do this:

```{r analyse_radi_and_checkmark}
# How to analyse the response to a radio question
opt1  <- data[data$trialType == "radio", 'options'] # Get the options
# Split the string by | and then use value as the index for opt1
resp1 <- strsplit(opt1, "\\|")[[1]][as.numeric(data[data$trialType == "radio", 'value'])] 

# How to analyse the response to a checkmark question
opt2  <- data[data$trialType == "checkmark", 'options'] # Get the options
opt2  <- strsplit(opt2, "\\|")[[1]] # Split the options into separate strings
# Do the same for the response
resp2 <- data[data$trialType == "checkmark", 'value'] # Get the response
resp2 <- strsplit(resp2, "\\|")[[1]] # Split the options into separate strings
resp2 <- ifelse(resp2 == "True", TRUE, FALSE)
# Now use this a boolean index and paste together
resp2 <- paste(opt2[resp2], collapse = ", ")
```

In the example data (see video), the participants responded with _`r resp1`_ in the radio question and with _`r resp2`_ in the checkmark question. 

## Log 
In the log you find the time stamps for every button press. Furthermore, it provides information but which platform is used (Windows/Mac), at which system time the experiment started and which version was used. Here is an example:  

- 10.53183,Log,Session start time 10/10/2022 4:49:43 PM,
- 10.53183,Log,Application Version : 1.0.0,
- 10.53183,Log,Platform used is UNITY_STANDALONE_WIN,

## Tracker
Additionally, UXF mouse tracker is enabled that tracks the mouse movement during te trials. This data can be analysed like this:

```{r mouse_tracker}
# Load libraries for custom_rbinder_addIndexColumn & plotting
library(assortedRFunctions) # Install with devtools::install_github("JAQuent/assortedRFunctions", upgrade = "never")
library(ggplot2)

# Task folder
taskFolder <- "QP_my_experiment/"
subjID     <- "subject1"

# Not this code will only work correctly if the folder only contains position tracker
# Get all files
path2tracker <- paste0(taskFolder, subjID, '/S001/trackers/') 
allTrackers  <- paste0(path2tracker, list.files(path2tracker))
  
# Get list of DFs
tempTracker <- lapply(allTrackers, read.csv)
  
# Add index as subject and then bind together
questions_mouseTracker <- custom_rbinder_addIndexColumn(tempTracker, "trial")

# Add resolution to tracker data
questions_mouseTracker$width      <- 1920 
questions_mouseTracker$height     <- 1080 
questions_mouseTracker$norm_pix_x <- questions_mouseTracker$pix_x/questions_mouseTracker$width
questions_mouseTracker$norm_pix_y <- questions_mouseTracker$pix_y/questions_mouseTracker$height

# Plot
ggplot(questions_mouseTracker,aes(norm_pix_x, norm_pix_y)) + 
  geom_bin2d() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = rev(rainbow(10))) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1), expand = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Mouse position as heat map during the trials", y = "y position", x = "x position")
```

# Ideas for the future
- A way to introduce a participant check list.
- A way to further customise the visual appearance (e.g. change background on trials to highlight different questionnaires),  
- Currently, any extra columns in the input .csv file are not copied to the data making adding supplementary information to the data a bit more cumbersome. Even though it would be a useful feature because one could question IDs and many other things, the issue is the fact that QP allows "," to be used in the strings for the questions etc. interferes with the `trial_results.csv`. For now, I therefore simply disabled this function and suggest to add this information at a later stage. 
- Add resolution to the log. 

Feedback or help is always welcome!
